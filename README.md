## About me
I am seeking employment in the field of Data Science because it is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the IT industry, demanded in solving various business processes, and essential in any sector.

The increasing number of respondents in databases, the complexity of tasks, the search for unconventional problem-solving methods in research, and the general trend towards increasing information volume worldwide have motivated me to learn new programming languages such as Python and SQL for data processing, analysis, visualization of results, and forecasting.

For additional convenience in data visualization, I have studied in-demand software packages such as Power BI, Metabase, and Redash.

I have chosen Python and SQL as my programming languages because they are the most convenient programming tools for solving tasks when working with big data, and they offer flexibility in solving analytical tasks.
